**Mobility mode choice model using Gipuzkoa (Spain) as a use case**

# Folders

    - [\model](https://github.com/Inigo-Azcarate/Mobility_Choice/tree/main/model) Main folder of the repository. It contains the code to create the supervised learning AI model that predicts the mobility choices. 
    - [\input_data](https://github.com/Inigo-Azcarate/Mobility_Choice/tree/main/input_data) Contains all the data necessary to run the AI model in the \model folder. Some of the containing data is raw and the rest is a result of the codes in the \preprocessing folder.
    - [\preprocessing](https://github.com/Inigo-Azcarate/Mobility_Choice/tree/main/preprocessing) Contains the codes and the raw data to create the files in input files in \input_data.

# Code files

    - `surveys.ipynb` cleans, treats and postprocessesof the survey data, adding salary data to each trip-taker
    - `analysis_graphics.ipynb`: generation of graphs related to mode of transportation from survey data
    - `population_generation.ipynb`: generation of a placeholder of ~2500 workers commuting to Eskuzaitzeta.
    - `landuse&section_aggregation.ipynb`: generation of a building database, including land use and neighborhood-wealth characteristics
    - `intermunicipal_travel_cost.ipynb`: calculation of travel fares between towns and regions for different public transport companies
    - `create_road_network.ipynb`: creation of the pandana road network from OpenStreetMaps to calculate driving times from origin to destination
    - `GTFS_transit_24.ipynb`: creation of the pandana transit networks (24, one for each hour) to calculate bus times from origin to destination
    - `GTFS_train_24.ipynb`: creation of the pandana train networks (24, one for each hour) to calculate bus times from origin to destination

    - `model.ipynb`: adds noise to survey data, assigns origin and destination to each trip, and calculates the mode of transportationâ€™s travel time and travel cost. Then, it trains the supervised learning AI model.
     - `predict.ipynb`: uses the aforementioned AI model (Random Forest Classifier) and predicts the mode of transportation for an specific population
